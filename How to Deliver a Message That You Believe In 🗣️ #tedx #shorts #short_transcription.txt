 two things. Number one, genuinely believing in the talk, believing in the concept, and then having a stage to deliver something that you feel genuinely called to. That feels remarkably fulfilling. I also think just the work you put into preparation and then to be able to deliver creates a sense of satisfaction. So I'm just honored and prayerful that what was said today is going to help some people get some real breakthroughs in life.
